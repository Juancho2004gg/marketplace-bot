# FB Marketplace Bot
A project that unites web scraping, databases and selenium automatization to save time in managing inventory and publishing products. This project only works for the company I work for. Main reason is because they have a webpage where the scraping part is done, also, the products that are published only consists of RVs (Recreational Vehicles).
